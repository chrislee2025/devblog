Making games is hard. If you want to make something that's fun for the user, then a lot of planning is necessary.

The first step is to understand the audience. This includes knowing:

1. The demographic of your users (age, gender, nationality, etc)

2. Their wants regarding the game (simplicity, number of levels, end goals)

3. Possible turnoffs (things that make a game no longer fun to play)

While planning our Golden Brain game out, we came to the understanding that our target audience was most likely going to be older women who wanted to either kill time or prevent Alzheimers, without the label of playing a "game."

Once we understood who we were making our final product for, we started to ideate possible products. Here are some of our ideas:

1) A Mathematical 3x3 Game - A game where you have to get the end result specific to each row or column by adding three numbers in the same row or column.

2) A Card Turning Game - A game where you have 30 cards (15 pairs) which are flipped face down and you have to make pairs as quickly as possible through memorization.

3) A Shape Finding Game - A game where you are given a shape made up of smaller shapes and have to find the number of a specific shape in the given shape.

After collecting all our ideas together, we managed to come up with a game to begin planning and coding.
