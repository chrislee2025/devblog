UX and UI are words that are thrown around in the technology community. They mean **U**ser E**X**perience and **U**ser **I**nterface respectively, but what are they, exactly?

A UI is easier to explain. Basically, if a user is interacting with a service or product, we can consider that a UI. Most of the time, UI refers to screens, buttons, toggles, icons, and other elements. This might be the "liked videos" button on *Youtube* or other buttons you can interact with on different sites.

Here are some photos of what a UI might look like:

All of these places you can go and buttons you can press are part of the UI.

In this game, the majority of the UI lies in the numbered buttons and the reset button.

And here, the UI is coded to show the squares and possible interactions with the user.

So UI, in summary, is all of the interactive elements a user interacts with directly.

UX is a concept that can be a little more difficult to grasp. For a user, it's hard to see a UX because a UX isn't something that a user does; rather, a UX is built from a user.

Think of UX as a big umbrella that encompasses the overall experience that users have while itneracting with a product, system, or service. It involves understanding and addressing users' needs, behaviors, emotions, and expectations at every stage of their journey with the product.

ChatGPT is a good example of a UX. ChatGPT understands your question, answers it, and learns from it. Within a few questions, it knows what sort of answers you want and makes your experience easier.

Another example would be in the game we're making.

When a user presses a square, the UX understands it needs to seamlessly flip the other squares, while also collecting data on stuff like touch speed to diagnose possible Alzheimer's disease.

In other words, UX is the information a user gives which developers use to make conclusions about said user.

While UI and UX may seem like very difficult concepts, hopefully this clears it up for you.
