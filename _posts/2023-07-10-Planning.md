UX and UI are words that are thrown around in the technology community. They mean **U**ser E**X**perience and **U**ser **I**nterface respectively, but what are they, exactly?

UX is a user's general interaction with a service. For example, the site which you're reading this is a UX. Another example might be the home page of *Youtube*. Basically, if a user is interacting with a service or product, we can consider that a UX.

And UI is a large umbrella of all the places a person comes into contact in a service or product. Most of the time, UI refers to screens, buttons, toggles, icons, and other elements. This might be the "liked videos" button on *Youtube*, as an example.
