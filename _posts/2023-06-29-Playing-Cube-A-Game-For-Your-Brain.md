You can find the game at this [link](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/cube.html).

#### The Point in Playing *Cube*

Cube is designed to improve:

- spatial awareness
- ability to think and plan ahead

By working on such skills, you are **58% less likely to get Alzheimers** while having fun!

#### The Basics of *Cube*

Now that we know the benefits of playing *Cube*, here are the basics. Creator Paul Scott explains it like this.

> "You have a grid of 16 squares, six of which are blue; on one square rests a cube. Your job is to get all six blue squares on to the six faces of the cube at the same time. Count your moves and try to do it in as few as possible."

To move your cube, you can use either your arrow keys or click to the place you want your cube to go.

That sounds simple, right? Just roll the cube until you get it all blue.

There's a catch.

If a colored side on your cube rolls over a blank tile, the cube will "drop" its color onto the tile.

*Before Rolling*

*Rolling*

*After Rolling*

You'll need to plan ahead and make sure not to make any mistakes.

#### An Extra Challenge Once You're Done

If you manage to finish the cube, you can always challenge yourself. You can choose 3 other options:

1. Tetrahedron - A triangular pyramid
